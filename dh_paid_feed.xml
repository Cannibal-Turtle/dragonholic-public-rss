      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Qi Ren, known as the “Mad Wolf” was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the “madman” harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu’an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, after the wedding, Fu Yu’an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the “madman” climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu’an kicked him off and exclaimed, “You’re not a fool?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To which Qi Ren retorted, “And you’re not mute, are you? We’re both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The Young Marquis Regrets Too Late</title>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-young-marquis-regrets-too-late/chapter-74/</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He could smile, she realised, but not for her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Qi Ren, known as the “Mad Wolf” was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the “madman” harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu’an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, after the wedding, Fu Yu’an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the “madman” climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu’an kicked him off and exclaimed, “You’re not a fool?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To which Qi Ren retorted, “And you’re not mute, are you? We’re both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>After Rebirth, I Married my Archenemy</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”&lt;br/&gt; The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”&lt;br/&gt; The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.&lt;br/&gt; ——&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. &lt;span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq"&gt;Bl00d&lt;/span&gt; poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Supporting the author&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rating or leaving a review on &lt;a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NovelUpdates&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dragonholic Discord server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release schedule:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Ning Yao died tragically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Ning Yao: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan’s ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; And Ning Yao’s lifelong wish is to ascend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;A perfect outcome for both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;So, she went in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;So, she went in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Ning Yao died tragically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Ning Yao: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan’s ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; And Ning Yao’s lifelong wish is to ascend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions.

She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky.

She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what happened to her in the end?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who knew he’d be reborn again…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky.

      <title>After Rebirth, I Married my Archenemy</title>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy//90/</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”&lt;br/&gt; The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”&lt;br/&gt; The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.&lt;br/&gt; ——&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. &lt;span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq"&gt;Bl00d&lt;/span&gt; poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Supporting the author&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rating or leaving a review on &lt;a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NovelUpdates&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dragonholic Discord server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release schedule:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

Perfect, I’m crazy too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Summary 2:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, “I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: “I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: “I’ve already graduated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I want to have a child. With you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, “I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: “I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: “I’ve already graduated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I want to have a child.

      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Qi Ren, known as the “Mad Wolf” was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the “madman” harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu’an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, after the wedding, Fu Yu’an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the “madman” climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu’an kicked him off and exclaimed, “You’re not a fool?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To which Qi Ren retorted, “And you’re not mute, are you? We’re both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Summary 1:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even if it’s a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Summary 2:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, “I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: “I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: “I’ve already graduated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I want to have a child. With you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Summary 1:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even if it’s a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Summary 2:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, “I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: “I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: “I’ve already graduated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I want to have a child. With you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

I have waited for this day.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan’s ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; And Ning Yao’s lifelong wish is to ascend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;A perfect outcome for both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;So, she went in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="summary__content show-more"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jeong Yeo-won wakes up from a frozen state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I opened my eyes, I found myself woke up 500 years later in a world that had already been destroyed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A monster suddenly appears from the gate.&lt;br/&gt; ‘Esper’, a godlike creature who has awakened his powers follow its lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the world is completely different from the past. Humans are no longer the masters of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Espers, who are supposed to hunt monsters and protect the city, are actually leading the world to further destruction due to their rampage. The ‘Guides’ that could calm the Espers have already disappeared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m a guide?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only guide who miraculously woke up in a discarded hibernation capsule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeo-won creates a guiding drug that slows down the rampage and distributes it around the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, the world is one step away from destruction,&lt;br/&gt; but now she must protect herself from the espers who seek to find and possess the guide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A drop of water that falls on dry land,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will it be able to moisten the earth, or will it dry up and disappear in the heat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>
